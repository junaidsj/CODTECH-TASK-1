# 🛠️ ETL Pipeline with Python, Pandas & Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline using Python, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`. It’s a foundational project that simulates real-world data processing workflows used in Data Science.

---

## 🔹 Extract

We simulate data extraction by creating a sample dataset using a Python dictionary. This dictionary contains basic **employee information** such as name, department, experience, and salary, which is then converted into a `pandas` DataFrame.

---

## 🔹 Transform

- Cleaned and transformed the data
- Applied operations like:
  - Handling missing values
  - Converting categorical data
  - Feature scaling using `scikit-learn` (`StandardScaler`)
  - Feature engineering (e.g., experience level grouping)

---

## 🔹 Load

The cleaned and transformed dataset is saved into a **CSV file** using `pandas.to_csv()`, simulating the "Load" phase of an ETL pipeline.
